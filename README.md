# Iphone_Sales
Apple iPhones rank among the top-selling smartphones globally. In India, where fierce competition among smartphone brands offers the latest technology at a fraction of the iPhone's cost, it's noteworthy that iPhones continue to maintain strong sales. If you're interested in analyzing iPhone sales in India, this project  is tailored for you.
In this project, I analysed the sales of Iphones in India using data from kaggle
I started by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset to get started with the task of iPhone sales analysis:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
